			<div class="page-content01">
            <p>The Japan Association for working holiday makers provides help and advice to people visiting Japan on Working Holiday Visas and to Japanese youths planning to travel overseas. We also provide working holiday makers with a job referral service. Another important aspect of our work is to promote awareness of the Working Holiday Scheme in Japan.<br />
Our offices are friendly, relaxed places where working holiday makers are welcome to pop in to receive useful advice, information, and encouragement.<br />
The purpose of the Working Holiday Scheme is to promote understanding between participating countries, and it is our hope that by staying in Japan on a Working Holiday Visa you will gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of Japanese culture, and that you in turn will act as an unofficial cultural ambassador and help the people you interact with to gain a better understanding of your culture, too.</p></div>

            <h3>Registration</h3>
            <div class="page-content02">
                <p>To use our services, you will need to register with our association. <s>Registration costs 1,000yen.</s> Please visit one of our offices with your passport <s>and two photos (3cm x 4cm)</s>. The information in our office is not open to people without membership, and jobs are only available to members who have registered in person and have attended our orientation meeting.</p>
                
                <h4>Orientation meeting</h4>
                <p>After registering there is a short, one-to-one meeting, where one of our counsellors will give you information and advice to prepare you for your life in Japan. The counsellor will also do his/her best to answer any questions you may have.</p>				
                
                <h4>Job referral services</h4>
                <p>You are able to apply for any of the jobs in our files, but you can only apply for up to two jobs per day. With luck, you may be able to find a job that suits you. As wages are generally paid on a monthly basis, most employers require you to work for at least three months. If you are planning to stay for less than three months and intend to work, then your employment opportunities will be substantially limited. We cannot guarantee that we will have jobs that are suitable for you all the time.</p>				
                
                <h4>Come to our parties!</h4>
                <p>A members-only working holiday party is held approximately once a month at our offices in Tokyo. To join you need to be registered at one of our offices. Please contact the Tokyo office to confirm the date and time.</p>

                <h5>・ What does the Japan Association for working holiday makers (JAWHM) do?</h5>
                <p>Our main job is to provide help to working holiday makers and promote the Working Holiday Scheme. We help people visiting Japan on Working Holiday Visas, and we also provide a variety of services to Japanese people who are planning to go on working holidays and to people who have returned to Japan from working holidays.</p>
                
                <h5>・ What services does your association provide for non-Japanese working holiday makers?</h5>
                <p>We have a free job referral service, we offer information about accommodation, and we provide a short one-to-one orientation session where one of our counsellors will provide you with information and advice about everyday life in Japan, and how to make the most of your stay. We also endeavor to answer any questions you might have during your stay in Japan.</p>
                
                <h5>・ Can you help me find accommodation?</h5>
                <p>We can provide you with information on what kinds of accommodation are available, e.g. local “guest house” accommodation etc., but we do not actually arrange accommodation for you. See the Life in Japan FAQ for more information about accommodation.</p>
                
                <h5>・ What kind of job referral service do you have?</h5>
                <p>People looking to employ working holiday makers send us information regarding jobs they are offering. We then display the job information files in our office. Only people who have registered with our association are allowed see the files. If you find a job you’re interested in, we explain the details to you, and provide you with contact information and a letter of introduction which you can take with you to the job interview. </p>
                
                <h5>・ How can I register with the Japan Association for working holiday makers?</h5>
                <p><s>Registration costs 1,000yen.</s> Please visit one of our offices in person with your passport <s>and two 3cm x 4cm ID photos (one for your member card, and one for our records)</s>.</p>

                <h5>・ Do I have to go to one of your offices in person to register?</h5>
                <p>Yes, you need to come to one of our offices in Tokyo. This is because we need to make sure you are actually in Japan on a Working Holiday Visa. We are considering making it possible in the future to register without having to visit one of our offices.</p>
                
                <h5>・ Can I search your job files over the Internet?</h5>

                <h5>・ I don’t have a Working Holiday Visa. Can I join your association anyway?</h5>
